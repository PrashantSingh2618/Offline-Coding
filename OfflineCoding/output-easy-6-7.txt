1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
Return the answer in an array.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

Example 2:
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 500
0 <= nums[i] <= 100



1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

We are given a list nums of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.
Consider each adjacent pair of elements [freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]] (with i >= 0).  For each such pair, there are freq elements with value val concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.
Return the decompressed list.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
Explanation: The first pair [1,2] means we have freq = 1 and val = 2 so we generate the array [2].
The second pair [3,4] means we have freq = 3 and val = 4 so we generate [4,4,4].
At the end the concatenation [2] + [4,4,4] is [2,4,4,4].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,3]

 
Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 100
nums.length % 2 == 0
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
