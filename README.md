# Offline-Coding

## Problem:-

Sometimes due to low internet speed and electricity issues some of our friends fail to submit the problems given in the google sheet and they lack and get demotivated . <br/>

## Solution
We have devised a solution for this problem by making a web portal in which one can give the starting and ending range of the problem statement and the choice of the category ie. easy , medium and hard . All the problem statements will get downloaded in a .txt file which can be used anytime to solve the problem . Students can code the solution offline and can submit the problem later . <br/>

### Google sheets should be in the following format :
